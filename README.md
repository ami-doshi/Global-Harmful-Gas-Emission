# Carbon Emissions in different countries around the globe		

### Team Members:
Ami Doshi, Abhinav Sharma

#### Purpose of Project: 
To analyze the carbon emissions in different countries across the globe and the measures implemented by successful countries i.e. the countries with low emission rate, which can be benefited by countries struggling with high emission rate.

<b>1. Business description </b>
In what industry does this organization reside? - Environment and sustainability
What products or services does it provide? - It provides solutions for reducing carbon emissions in countries where carbon emissions are high and are causing a problem such as health risk to humans and animals.
What are its general business functions? - It is a non-profit organization focused on analyzing the data to provide better carbon reduction patterns.

 
<b>2. Problem statement </b> <br>
What data management problem are you trying to solve? - The current databases present globally have a large scope and do not focus specifically on carbon emissions.
Carbon Emissions are a leading cause of health risks in todayâ€™s world, both to humans as well as animals. They also cause bad effects on water quality, air quality, marine life and ozone layer.

 
<b>3. Proposed solution </b> <br>
To narrow down the scope and better help the countries at risk to identify their carbon emission risks and its effects on health of humans, animals, marine life and Ozone layer. We will be specifically focusing on Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide for carbon emissions.
 
<b>4. Users</b> <br>
This Database can be made public for researchers and general global population for the purposes of awareness. Governments of the concerned countries can access this database and determine their plan of action for reducing carbon emissions to increase the quality of life for their citizens.

<b>5) Business Rules: </b> <br>
1.	All Co and CO2 levels will be measured in percentage
2.	Only the Data collected over the span of last 10 years will be considered
3.	Completed Database will be available for All to use for research purposes free of cost
4.	Ozone layer depletion will be estimated on a global level and not for each country or region
5.	Creators of the database have the right to determine which factors to include in the analysis
